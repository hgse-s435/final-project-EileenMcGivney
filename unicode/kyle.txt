yeah it was more independent and it was work but it didn’t feel as much like work because we could do what we wanted. we liked exploring, and trying out in the tolerance tanks and comparison tanks trying out all the different combinations.yeah the squirrels.yeah its more hands-on, I guess. In the lab its more like what I thought it was but the stuff where you go around and take the population data and stuff. I didn’t really think that part was science but it is.probably like collect data, and come up with new ideas from existing knowledge. not exactly, but it definitely helped me see what’s happening…I didn’t exactly know that the collecting data was part of being a scientist. yeahI have no idea, something like along the lines… I don’t know…well I like theoretical stuff, I try to… I try to propose theories about stuffThe speed of light is kind of- on the spectrum, we exist in a place-space-time where the speed of light is our highest point. What if there’s other places, dimensions, times- on a spectrum there could be multiple universes?try to ask questions and answering them, trying to find all the different types of relationships between different things. well my parents are both doctors, and my mom does research on cervical cancer, so I guess good scientists makes connections and tries to understand the entirety of what they are dealing with tries to not be ignorant, tries to be deep understanding. And tries to have their thought encompass all the variations, and elements of what is happening. I mean, I enjoy science. I enjoy doing science. I guess as a subject it’s my favorite. I guess depending on the teachers it might not always be my favorite class, fluctuates from day to day or year to year. But its my favorite subject.
