Yeah it was really fun- before in science class we had a curriculum and we had to it every day, but in ecoxpt we could like go and choose on what to do every day and choose our own branch of evidence and decide what we’re going to do with it. and the animals were really funny, like how they moved. Like the squirrels. it’s more outdoors than I thought I thought it would be like in the lab, and on the computer more, and the outdoors- I didn’t know about going outside and the tolerance tank, and going into the lake like the submarine and stuff. collect data to make an inference, and get evidence to support that inference. it could be more fun than I thought. like what they doyeah I probably wouldn’t do it for a job but it was fun. MaybeI want to be a defense attorney for criminal justice.I mean all the evidence seeking, all those tools, I might use in any job or in school when you’re reading an essay or something.yeah I doyou would take evidence for a criminal case like from the dude’s house and try to piece it together.my family’s friends, they’re both scientists, and they’re in charge of animal studies I guess, and guess they’re good because they go to a lot of places and learn about what they do a lot, they work a lot.they have to understand what they are doing, try to understand what they are doing, and use it to make the evidence, and if it doesn’t match up with their hypothesis they have to come up with a new one and try to find the evidence that fits. Or try to find the hypothesis that fits the evidence not the other way around. he’s kind of modest he is very good at science. I think we’re both good at science and it’s kind of fun.
