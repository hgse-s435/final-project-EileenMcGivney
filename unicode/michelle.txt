
I thought it was kind of cool, or and. it was kind of fun but it was kind of like boring a bit.

We were... I don't really know... we kind of did the same things every single day.


Well, I used to think that scientists…  that they didn't do experiments outside the lab and now I know that they do.

No, not really.

They do a lot of experiments and they try to solve things.

Problems, not math problems but problems.

No not really.

From my mom and my dad, my grandparents are scientists and they tell me a lot about it.

Well, I but I'm more interested in law. but science is cool.

It's like math, you’re always solving problems and I like solving problems.

It seems like a hard job.

 I guess.

It might be more dangerous. I wouldn't really consider myself a science person.

Science isn't my best subject, I'm not great at it.

 Yeah.

They are good at science..?

Being smart.


… Well no.

People who are good at science are people that like science.


 I don't really know.

Well, I'll know more about fishes

No I don't think so.



Not really, no.


 Yeah I guess. I didn't know they did torture tanks and stuff like.

It was kind of sad because I like fishes and I don't want them…

 Yeah.

Not really.

In 5th grade we made ecosystems with fish.

 Yeah.



 Well,  I can tell my parents about torture tanks.


First we did it on a computer and it was like Minecraft, the way we got to move.

We got to experiment with the computer and stuff.

 I don't think in 7th grade we have.


 I don't think so.

We got to use a computer.  I don't know.

No not really.


Yeah I definitely would.  I think it's different than a lot of the other experiments we do in class. we got to... I don't really know how to explain it. Got to try different things, like the tools and everything.

I think it's good for some students because I feel like a lot of people were really really bored and didn't like it.
