
It was fun. Collecting data.

I'm not really sure.


I didn't really have any.

I don't know... basically just tried to figure out things about the world.


Not really.

Good way to test hypotheses.

Yeah.

I forgot.

Not really.

Not really.


Maybe.

I don't know. 

It lets you know more about the world.

Because I prefer math.


Maybe.

 I don't know.

 It could.  It could help you figure out why historical events happened.

Wanting to know more.

Having questions that they want to answer.  Research.

Instead of just saying “I wonder why this is true”, you can actually try and find the answer by looking it up and asking people.
I don't know, not really.


If you're trying to figure out how something works then,  that could be helpful...

There weren't assigned things to read or experiments to do.  you didn't have experiments that you specifically had to do,  It was a good idea to do.

Yeah. 

Collecting a bunch of your own data instead of just doing something once, and then getting data from other people as well.
